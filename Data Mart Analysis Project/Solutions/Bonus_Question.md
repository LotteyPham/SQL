Do the same the previous questions to find `@week_number_event` of `'2020-06-15'`

```TSQL
DECLARE @week_number_event INT = (
  SELECT DISTINCT week_number
  FROM clean_weekly_sales
  WHERE week_date = '2020-06-15');
```
Then, depend on areas we analyze, change `SELECT` and `GROUP BY`

### **Sales by Region**

```TSQL
WITH salesChanges_region AS (
SELECT
	region,
	SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN @week_number_event-12 AND @week_number_event-1 THEN sales END) AS before_changes,
	SUM(CASE WHEN week_number BETWEEN @week_number_event AND @week_number_event+11 THEN sales END) AS after_changes
FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE calendar_year = 2020
GROUP BY region)

SELECT 
	*,
	CAST(100.0 * (after_changes-before_changes)/before_changes AS decimal(5,2)) AS pct_change
FROM salesChanges_region
ORDER BY pct_change
```
Result:

|region		|before_changes	|after_changes	|pct_change|
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
|ASIA			|1637244466		|1583807621		|-3.26|
|OCEANIA		|2354116790		|2282795690		|-3.03|

|EUROPE		|108886567		|114038959		|4.73|

**Insights and recommendations:**
 * Overall, the sales of most regions decreased after changing packages.
 * The highest negative impact was in ASIA with 3.26%. The company should reduce the number of products with sustainable packages here. 
 * Only EUROPE get a significant increase of 4.73%. The company should invest more in Europe.

FROM clean_weekly_sales
WHERE calendar_year = 2020
GROUP BY platform)

SELECT 
	*,
	CAST(100.0 * (after_changes-before_changes)/before_changes AS decimal(5,2)) AS pct_change
FROM salesChanges_platform
ORDER BY pct_change
```
Result:

|platform	|before_changes	|after_changes	|pct_change
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------
